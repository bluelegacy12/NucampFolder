            <h3>"Ivy"</h3>
            <img class="fam" src="images/ivy3ds.jpg" alt="cat in a lap looking at Nintendo 3DS">
            <p>That's me! I was much younger in this picture, but I do love watching my owners play games! I also like to explore new places. I'd say I'm the bravest and most curious explorer out of my whole family! But nothing beats a nice warm laptime with my owners.</p>

            <h2>Mother:</h2>

            <h3>"Momma"</h3>
            <img class="fam" src="images/momma.jpg" alt="calico cat on a black table">
            <p>This is my mom who just goes by the name "Momma"! She is very calm and magestic. Super shy and jumpy around new people, but very comfortable around our owners.</p>

            <h2>Siblings:</h2>
            <hr>
            <img class="fam" src="images/cattrio.jpg" alt="three cats on a window sill"> <img class="fam" src="images/eveash.jpg" alt="two cats cuddling on the back of a gold couch">
            <p>Me and my two siblings! I'm in the middle! And the second picture is just of my siblings.</p>
            <h3>"Eve"</h3>
            <img class="fam" src="images/eve.jpg" alt="a white cat with tabby spots in a lap with a game controller">
            <p>This is my sister Eve, she is a cool and down-to-earth feline friend-o-mine! She is also shy of new people and has very strict demands for attention from our owners at certain times of the day. She also has a dedicated spot in the bed at bedtime and she never misses it!</p>
            <h3>"Ash"</h3>
            <img class="fam" src="images/ashback.jpg" alt="a large tabby cat laying on a man's back who is lieing on the floor">
            <p>Introducing the largest member of our family, my brother Ash! Some say he looks unwelcoming from his face, but he's actually the friendliest and least shy of us all! He always wants to meet new people and treats them just like his new best friend. His tail is slightly shorter and fluffier than the rest of us, and he has no flexibility or bendability with his tail, so it always goes straight up or wags like a dog!</p>
            <h3>"Daxter"</h3>
            <img class="fam" src="images/happydaxter.jpg" alt="a dark tabby cat in a lap">
            <p>This is my older half brother, Daxter! He has a different father than us, but he helped raise the three of us when my mom had another litter after him! He can be quite skittish and jumpy, but he's still a very happy kitty.</p>

            <h3>"Jackie"</h3>
            <img class="fam" src="images/jackieivy.jpg" alt="a white and gray cat is looking up a a tabby kitten from underneat a black couch">
            <p>This is Jackie (and younger me on top!), she ran the house before the rest of us arrived. She was not very happy to share her space with us new cats, but she's come around since and is actually very nice. She still likes her space though from the rest of us from time to time.</p>
